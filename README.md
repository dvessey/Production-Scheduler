# Production-Scheduler
A scheduling system for machine shops to prioritize jobs

NOTE: Right now dragging a project to an empty table is only working in firefox, so make sure you are using firefox for now.

The very first project in the list of projects assigned to a machine will be set to the current date and time, and all other projects start and end dates 
will be calculated accordingly when you drag a project within the same machine or move to another machine.
When you move a project from one machine to another, sorting and calculating happens on both machines.
